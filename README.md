# reed-solomon
Python implementation of the Reed-Solomon encoding/decoding algorithm, without taking erasures into account.


# If you have any questions : 
If you understand french a bit, I've added a .ipynb file that you can open with Sagemath Notebook, as I'm only in 2nd year of IT and Galois Fields are usually taught in 4th-ish year, there might be some inaccuracies in the explanations.
Else you can still click the links explaining most of the algorithms used (Chien search, etc ).
Either way, feel free to reach me if you'd like

As it was a school project, I needed to have everything in a single file, sorry if that disturbs you !

Thanks !
